Project Analysis — User Profile
  The final user of this website is mainly a recruiter or hiring manager who is looking for junior front-end developers or web designers.
  This user usually works reviewing many CVs. Therefore, they expect a clear, structured, and visually appealing presentation that helps them understand the candidate’s profile.

Project Analysis — Information Architecture
  The website follows a single-page structure that allows users to navigate easily through different sections without reloading the page.
  At the top of the page, a fixed navigation bar provides quick access to each section: About, Education, Skills, Experience, Projects, and Contact. This makes it easy for visitors, such as recruiters, to move directly to the information they are most interested in.
  The layout is divided into three main zones. On the left, the user can find a photo and contact information, which act as a visual introduction. The center and right areas are used for the main content.
  At the bottom, a footer displays the last update date and additional information.
  
Project analysis — Visual design
  The visual design of the website is based on a clean, structured, and professional layout that highlights my personal invented brand as a web designer.
  The page uses a two-column structure on desktop screens: the left column contains the personal photo and contact information, while the right column displays the main content such as Education, Skills, and Experience.
  This organization ensures clarity and allows the viewer to easily locate relevant information.
  I used a red color palette to do all the CV. I used a deep red for the main title, the navigation bar and the footer. Then, Iused a soft red for highlighted areas. 
  The mobile version adapts the layout to a single column, stacking the elements vertically for better usability on small screens.
  Consistent spacing, rounded corners, and light shadows are applied to create visual harmony and depth.
  The fixed navigation bar ensures smooth navigation between sections, enhancing user experience.
